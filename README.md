# EMMA Healthcare Admin Panel V2

A modern, HIPAA-compliant healthcare administration platform built for medical education and residency management.

## What's New

### ESLint Configuration for Healthcare Project

This ESLint configuration is specifically designed for healthcare applications, emphasizing HIPAA compliance, security, and modern development practices using TypeScript, React, and Next.js.

#### Key Enhancements

**1. Healthcare/HIPAA Compliance Rules**

Security-First Approach for Sensitive Data

- **No sensitive data patterns**: Prevents hardcoded SSN, DOB, and other sensitive information
- **Audit trail logging**: Warns about console.log usage in production environments
- **Restricted syntax**: Catches potential HIPAA violations at lint time

**2. TypeScript Strictness**

Type Safety and Code Quality

- **Strict null checks**: Enforces optional chaining and nullish coalescing
- **No explicit any**: Warns about `any` usage to maintain type safety
- **Unused variables**: Allows underscore prefix for intentionally unused variables

**3. React Best Practices**

Modern React Development Standards

- **Hook rules**: Enforces React hooks rules for proper usage
- **JSX validation**: Prevents common JSX errors and anti-patterns
- **Component patterns**: Enforces modern React patterns and best practices

**4. Next.js Optimization**

Performance and SEO Excellence

- **Image optimization**: Enforces Next.js Image component usage
- **Performance rules**: Prevents common Next.js performance issues
- **SEO rules**: Enforces SEO best practices for better search visibility

**5. File-Specific Rules**

Context-Aware Linting

- **API routes**: Allows console logging for server-side debugging
- **Test files**: Relaxed rules for testing environment flexibility
- **Config files**: Allows require() and console usage where appropriate

**6. Security Considerations**

Comprehensive Security Measures

- **No dangerous patterns**: Prevents dangerous React patterns
- **Import validation**: Ensures clean import structure
- **Code quality**: Enforces consistent code patterns across the codebase

#### Why This Configuration Supports Our Healthcare Project

#### Usage in Development Workflow

**Available Commands**

```bash
npm run lint          # Check all files
npm run lint:fix      # Auto-fix issues
npm run dev          # Next.js will use this during development
```

**Git Hooks Integration**

Pre-commit Quality Assurance

- Pre-commit hook runs ESLint automatically
- Commit fails if there are linting errors
- Automatic fixing for simple issues
- Ensures code quality before it reaches the repository

### Enhanced Prettier Configuration for Healthcare Project

This document outlines the recommended Prettier configuration optimized specifically for healthcare applications, emphasizing readability, consistency, and compliance with modern development standards.

#### Key Improvements from Standard Configuration

| Setting | Standard Value | Healthcare Value | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `printWidth` | 80 | 100 | Better accommodation for healthcare form layouts |
| `trailingComma` | "es5" | "all" | Modern standard, reduces git conflicts |
| `arrowParens` | "avoid" | "always" | TypeScript consistency |
| `quoteProps` | - | "as-needed" | Object property consistency |
| `proseWrap` | - | "preserve" | Better for documentation |

#### Complete Configuration

```json
{
  "printWidth": 100,
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "useTabs": false,
  "semi": true,
  "singleQuote": true,
  "trailingComma": "all",
  "bracketSpacing": true,
